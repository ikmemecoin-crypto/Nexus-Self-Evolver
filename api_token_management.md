To manage API token limits, consider implementing the following strategies:
1. **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the impact of a compromised key.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse and reduce the likelihood of hitting token limits.
3. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API requests made and minimize the load on the API.
4. **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to manage API requests, handle rate limiting, and provide an additional layer of security.
5. **Monitor API Usage**: Continuously monitor API usage and adjust strategies as needed to ensure compliance with token limits.
