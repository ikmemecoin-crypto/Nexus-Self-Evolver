To further optimize API token management, consider the following best practices:
1. **Use Environment Variables**: Store API keys as environment variables to keep them secure and out of version control.
2. **Implement API Key Validation**: Validate API keys on each request to ensure they are legitimate and not compromised.
3. **Use Secure Storage**: Store API keys in a secure storage solution, such as a secrets manager or a secure key-value store.
4. **Limit API Key Access**: Restrict access to API keys to only those who need them, using techniques like role-based access control.
5. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity**: Continuously monitor API usage for suspicious activity and adjust strategies as needed.
